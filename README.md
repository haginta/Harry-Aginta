### Working papers (under review)
1. Regional growth, convergence, and heterogeneity in Sumatra: Evidence from new satellite data (2021) 
   > **Abstract:** The use of night-time lights data are increasingly applied for assessing performance of economies. This paper attempts to examine regional growth convergence across 147 districts in Sumatra over the period 2012-2020 using satellite night-time lights data. We first evaluate the usefulness of the night-time lights indicator in the context of Sumatra regions. Results show that almost 77 percent of the variability in (official) GDP per capita can be explained by this satellite night-time lights data of GDP. Next, given its potential advantage for predicting regional GDP, we evaluate the existence of convergence and the role of spatial heterogeneity across Sumatra districts. Our findings support the evidence of heterogeneity both in convergence patterns and the role of growth determinants across districts, in addition to observed overall (average) process of regional convergence. Specifically, the northern parts of Sumatra experience a higher speed of convergence compared to the southern area. In addition, internet and credit access demonstrate significant yet different magnitude across Sumatra districts. Looking from policy perspectives, our findings suggest that one-size-fits-all policy is not desirable for promoting equal growth across Sumatra districts. Spatially-based policies are instead more demanded to support equal growth.
    
2. Does GVC participation help industrial upgrading in developing countries? New evidence from panel data analysis (2021)
   > **Abstract:** This paper assesses the impact of manufacturing global value chain (GVC) participation on industrial upgrading in developing countries. After constructing a novel manufacturing GVC dataset for 37 countries from 2001 to 2017, we apply panel fixed-effect estimation to evaluate whether value chain integration could lead to industrial upgrading. Our findings show that increasing participation in manufacturing GVC has led to structural change in the industrial sector. In the baseline model, we find a percentage rise in manufacturing GVC corresponds to 0.35 – 0.43 % increase in the share of high-tech sector. Further analysis reveals that the upgrading channel is primarily derived from forward linkages, while backward linkages contribute in diminishing low-tech manufacturing activities. Our findings are robust under alternative specification methods. This linear transformation confirms earlier studies and thus highlights the critical role of GVC in promoting industrial upgrading in developing countries.
   
3. Spatio-temporal dynamics of regional inflation in Indonesia (2022)
   > **Abstract:** This study analyzes regional inflation dynamics in Indonesia through a spatio-temporal context. We employ an Exploratory Space-Time Data Analysis (ESTDA) on inflation data and its components of 34 provinces in Indonesia during three different episodes within 2012-2019 time span; rising inflation (2012-2013), declining inflation (2014-2015), and stable inflation (2018-2019). We discover a variety of spatially coordinated movements in inflation dynamics across episodes, implying the transmission of price changes in a particular region to neighboring regions. The foodstuffs component appears to be the primary source of the spatial process of aggregate inflation. Our findings have significant implications on the relevance of including spatial dimension in analyzing and formulating policy measures to control regional inflation in Indonesia.

4. Revisiting the Phillips curve for Indonesia: What can we learn from regional data? (2022)
   > **Abstract:** This study seeks new empirical evidence of the Phillips curve in Indonesia, an emerging and geographically diversified economy. There are three important contributions from this research. First, applying panel econometric method to exploit regional variation, the study resolves the issue of using on-target national inflation rates that potentially causes weakening inflation-output link. Second, the research examines the relevance of mining industry for output gap measurement at regional level. Third, it highlights the differences in the Phillips curve between the west and east regions owing to their different underlying economic structures. Our estimation using regional data support the validity of the Phillips curve relationship in Indonesia. Backward-looking inflation expectations, exchange rate dynamics and international commodity prices also significantly affect inflation. In addition, the elasticity of the output gap is higher if the mining sector is excluded from output gap measurement. Finally, we find apparent differences between the west and the eastern regions in the slope of Phillips curve, as well as in the degree of inflation persistence and exchange rate pass-through. Our findings add significantly to the empirical literature on the Phillips curve and have meaningful policy implications.
