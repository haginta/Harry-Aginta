### Working papers
1. Regional growth, convergence, and heterogeneity in Sumatra: Evidence from new satellite data (Conference paper of Sumatranomics, 2021) with Ragdad C. Miranti and SS Yan.
   > **Abstract:** The use of night-time lights data are increasingly applied for assessing performance of economies. This paper attempts to examine regional growth convergence across 147 districts in Sumatra over the period 2012-2020 using satellite night-time lights data. We first evaluate the usefulness of the night-time lights indicator in the context of Sumatra regions. Results show that almost 77 percent of the variability in (official) GDP per capita can be explained by this satellite night-time lights data of GDP. Next, given its potential advantage for predicting regional GDP, we evaluate the existence of convergence and the role of spatial heterogeneity across Sumatra districts. Our findings support the evidence of heterogeneity both in convergence patterns and the role of growth determinants across districts, in addition to observed overall (average) process of regional convergence. Specifically, the northern parts of Sumatra experience a higher speed of convergence compared to the southern area. In addition, internet and credit access demonstrate significant yet different magnitude across Sumatra districts. Looking from policy perspectives, our findings suggest that one-size-fits-all policy is not desirable for promoting equal growth across Sumatra districts. Spatially-based policies are instead more demanded to support equal growth.

2. Revisiting the Phillips curve for Indonesia: What can we learn from regional data? (2022, under review)
   > **Abstract:** This study seeks new empirical evidence of the Phillips curve in Indonesia, an emerging and geographically diversified economy. There are three important contributions from this research. First, applying panel econometric method to exploit regional variation, the study resolves the issue of using on-target national inflation rates that potentially causes weakening inflation-output link. Second, the research examines the relevance of mining industry for output gap measurement at regional level. Third, it highlights the differences in the Phillips curve between the west and east regions owing to their different underlying economic structures. Our estimation using regional data support the validity of the Phillips curve relationship in Indonesia. Backward-looking inflation expectations, exchange rate dynamics and international commodity prices also significantly affect inflation. In addition, the elasticity of the output gap is higher if the mining sector is excluded from output gap measurement. Finally, we find apparent differences between the west and the eastern regions in the slope of Phillips curve, as well as in the degree of inflation persistence and exchange rate pass-through. Our findings add significantly to the empirical literature on the Phillips curve and have meaningful policy implications.
   
3. Spatial Okun’s law for a set of islands? The case of Indonesia (2022, under review) with Casto Martin Montero Kuscevic and Carlos Mendez.
   > **Abstract:** This paper estimates the Okun’s law using a spatial panel approach for Indonesian’s districts over the period 2009-2020. Given the geography of the archipelago, we deviate from the traditional definitions of neighbors and use instead a Thiessen polygons structure to capture the spillovers from neighboring regions. Our results show that the Okun’s Law relies heavily on the regional economic and industrial structure, revealing a differentiated Okun’s coefficient for eastern (agrarian) and western (industrialized) provinces. The magnitude of the spillovers support the appropriateness of using the Thiessen polygons structure to build the weight matrix.
   
4. Inflation dynamics in Indonesia: A regional perspective (2022, under review)
   > **Abstract:** This study empirically models the Phillips curve using data from 34 Indonesian provinces from 2015 to 2019 and makes three primary contributions to the literature. First, in light of the observed flattening Phillips curve in recent years, which may be related to the adoption of the Inflation Targeting Framework (ITF), this study tests the Phillips curve relationship using subnational data in a panel structure. Second, it is the first attempt to model inflation dynamics in Indonesia while factoring in spatial externality or spillover effects. Third, the study contrasts alternative measurements of inflation and output gap. The results show the presence of a conventional Phillips curve with distinct behaviour of spatial spillover effects across different measurement of inflation and output gap.
  
5. Explaining regional income convergence in China: An exploratory spatio-temporal perspective (2022, under review) with Chen Yilin and Kpoviessi Dohèto Othniel.
   > **Abstract:** Uneven regional development has become an issue in China since the Open and Reform Policy in the 1980s. The imbalance can be observed as the ”coastal west divide” in previous convergence studies. This paper aims to contribute to the mainstream of the convergence study by including the role of space, analyzing three economic indicators, regional income, investment, and human capital, from 1999 to 2017. In contrast to inconsistent results in investment and human capital as conditioning factors in the previous income convergence study, this research found consistent results using either classical convergence or the new exploratory technique in spatial analysis. Our findings confirm the investment-driven economy in China and suggest that investment mainly facilitates the convergence trend of regional income and gradually nar- rows the coastal-wide divide. At the same time, there is no significant con- vergence in human capital, whether including the role of space or not. These findings suggest that the promotion of low-income regions with better spatial connectivity could achieve balanced regional development.
